# PLAYlists

Something that's been missing from music streaming services is the ability not just to have public playlists, but to allow other users to contribute to those playlists. PLAYlists fixes this problem by using the Spotify API to create curated playlists that the community is able to add to.

Upon visiting the site, users are prompted to sign-in using their Spotify account. Once signed in, users can navigate through the playlists on the site. (Initially - to keep things simple - playlists will be based around genres: Hip-Hop, Pop, R&B, Rock, etc.)

When a user clicks on a playlist, that opens the Playlist component where they will see a list of songs that have been added, as well as the name of the user who added each song. Users can then explore the playlist. They'll be able to listen to the playlist in its entirety or listen to specific songs as they so choose. If they like a song and wish to add it to their personal Spotify account, they'll be able to do that too.

## Nothing new, right? But wait!

If a user has a song they feel would be a good fit for the playlist, there will be a Suggest Song function. Users can search Spotify from our app for songs, artists, albums, then click the song they want and it will go into a Pending Songs component where it will wait for upvotes. If it receives enough upvotes from the community within a certain amount of time, then it joins the playlist proper.
